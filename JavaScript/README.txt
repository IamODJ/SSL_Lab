The name of the html file denotes the Question it is addressing. 

In question 3 there was a discrepancy about the form of input. 
Some were taking input of the form a,b,c,d but I feel the output was supposed to show the formatted input string by putting commas between characters.
So I have used a general case where any string input can be taken.

Thank you
